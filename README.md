# Student-in-Service-Calendar-Generator
The Student-in-Service is a very common concept in Romanian schools. Basically, the students who are in service that day, are the ones responsible with cleaning the blackboards and keeping the classroom clean and tidy. 

This app does just that! You insert the students in any order you wish, either from the software built-in menus or from an external text file, and it automatically generates an Excel Spreadsheet on a set period of time, in a real calendar (usually itâ€™s best to set full months).

I developed it in order to fix a common problem we had in our classroom. Every month, someone had to create a spreadsheet with all the students, so we would know who is going to be the one in service that day. And they had to re-write this spreadsheet over and over, every month, in order to keep the correct rotation of the students.
